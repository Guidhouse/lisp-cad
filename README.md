# lisp-cad

## Working with Clojure/Lisp for openscad 3D modelling.

OpenScad is a wonderful tool for modelling boolean shapes for 3D printing, but have a limitted language for expressing the models programmatically.

Fortunately [Matthew Farrell](https://github.com/farrellm)  has written an [openScad DSL in clojure](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj), which I will use. 

This is to see if I can enhance both my lisp-skills and 3D modelling skills at the same time.
And hopefully create more wonderfully complex 3D models and learn something on the way.
